```


```{r loading in data}
here()
gage_data <- read_csv(here('Final_Project/Data/Raw/Elwha_Streamgage_2011to2016.csv'))
head(gage_data)
#noise versus bad in "flag" col 
#take out data buried, noise, bad; view metadata

sediment_data <- read_csv(here('Final_Project/Data/Raw/Elwha_DailySedimentLoads_2011to2016.csv'))
head(sediment_data)
```

Ideas 

Time Series 
- stream gage time series, maybe average each day
    - question: is there a trend? is there a seasonal trend?
    - is there a change in stream gage levels before and after dam removal?
    - did the trend change?
    



Spatial 
- make a map locating the dam
